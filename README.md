# Audiophile e-commerce

I'm excited to present this e-commerce website, a project I developed to demonstrate my skills as a frontend developer. This multi-page full responsive e-commerce site, built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, showcases my proficiency in these modern web development technologies.

## Project Highlights:

- **Figma Design Implementation:** I meticulously translated a Figma design file into a fully functional and responsive website. The attention to detail in matching the design's aesthetics and interactions demonstrates my commitment to creating pixel-perfect user interfaces.
